### Other
- ✅ add a useful pester test. don't need nupkg anymore since in gallery, no idea how that 8fdea0f got in there (8fdea0f)
- a bit weird. I'm including the BuildOutput generated by Press and going to try and use the Github Action \ publish.ps1 to publish the built module. I have not figured out how to make Press and Actions play together. so I am doing the press build locally with the devcontainer (0f29dc4)
- tap doesn't require psframework, thats for the build system. nupkg may be useful (5263733)
- initial commit (4c11c0b)
